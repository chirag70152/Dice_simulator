# Dice_simulator
This is a dice simulator which simply return a nummber between 1 to 6 and ask the user wheather he/she want to play role the dice again.
if the player answers yes, then it will again give number between 1 to 6 and if user answers no than it will display 'bye!' and will end the project.
This is my first python project which is beginner friendly and takes only 20-30 minnutes to mmae.
